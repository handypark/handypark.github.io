	<h1>AC 209a: Final Project</h1>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>
	To proceed on our work, we took our combined our play-by-play data that we had matched up with our batting and fielding data,
	and first cleaned it to make sure it did not contain any "not available" or missing fields. From time to time, we had batters
	who had no available information (one notable case being that of rookie players in 2017), for whom we had to drop their plate
	appearances - such cases were only around 5% of the total data that we had collected, so it was acceptable for us to drop these
	players (especially since our questions only dealt with understanding which players should bat given that we already know how
	well they did in the previous year). To create our training, testing, and validation data sets, we first sampled 10% of the 
	data after this dropping procedure, and then split our data into 60% training, 20% testing, 20% validation.
	</p>
	<p>
	Then, we proceeded to use our training data to train models that would tell us, given a data point for a plate appearance
	(complete with batting statistics for the batter, defensive statistics for the fielding team, and current game state), how
	many runs the batter would score on that plate appearance (from 0 through 4), classifying each plate appearance into one of
	these five possible outcomes for the number of runs scored.
	</p>
	<h3>Initial Baseline Model</h3>
	<p>
	As our initial baseline model, we used a logistic regression with cross-validation in order to predict how many runs a given
	plate appearance would score. Fitting on our training data, we then got an accuracy score of 90.3% - which seemed extremely
	promising, until we realized the following problem: the model was predicting that every plate appearance would result in a
	play that scored no runs. No plate appearances were predicted to have any runs at all, which was correct around 90% of the time,
	but wouldn't be useful in terms of giving us any predictive power in terms of how one batter might do compared to another
	batter in given scenarios. 
	</p>
	<h3>Attempting to Model Plate Appearance Outcomes</h3>
	<p>
	Given our previous fears of an unbalanced dataset and the lack of performance from our baseline model, we knew that finding
	a model to predict the number of runs a given plate appearance would score would be quite difficult. Indeed, the more and more
	we looked at our data and at our baseline model, the more we became convinced that it might be the case that the results of
	individual plays in scoring or not scoring runs might be relatively noisy and not well related to any of our predictors. It 
	seemed that plays most often seemed to score no runs, and that runs scored were few and far in between and not very predictable.
	</p>
	<p>
	Still, to confirm these possible trends, we trained a variety of models that we thought might be able to predict the number of
	runs that a plate appearance would yield with greater success (and better differentiate the probabilities of possible outcomes
	for plate appearances). We tried each and every single one of the following modeling methods to classify plate appearances into
	0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 runs scored:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Multinomial Logistic Regression:</strong> A logistic regression for sorting our data into the five possible
			classifications (the five possible numbers of runs scored by a play) using multinomial classification rather
			than a one-versus rest approach where each classification is done as a binary classification problem.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Balanced Classes' Logistic Regression:</strong> We weighted the five possible classifications so that they weren't
			unbalanced and would hopefully predict that runs would be scored more often, even if bias was introduced.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>K-Nearest Neighbors:</strong> We hoped that a model that just clustered classifications based on the most similar
			plays that had happened would be able to predict when runs would be scored.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Decision Tree:</strong> We used a decision tree that would try to cut the data into sections based on cutoffs in the
			predictors' values, and then obtain classifications as a result.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Random Forest:</strong> Similar to decision trees, except we set up a great many decision trees that are each trained
			on random subsets of the training data with random predictors dropped out in each tree, and have a majority
			vote from the random forests to determine classification.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Boosting:</strong> We used AdaBoost to try to reduce bias error in our model and try to produce better results.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>PCA:</strong> We use our predictor variables to generate new "principal components" that are linearly uncorrelated and
			might do better at classifying plate appearances.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, every single one of these methods gave us the same result: <strong>Every plate appearance was still
		predicted to yield no runs.</strong> What this meant was that what we had feared might be true: our predictors might
		not be able to predict when a given plate appearance would score one run or more runs rather than no runs. 
	</p>
	<h3>Revising our Study Question and Creating Our Final Model</h3>
	<p>
		But not all hope was lost. While we couldn't evaluate models on the basis of how accurately they discretely classified
		outcomes of plate appearances into the number of runs scored, we could still evaluate these models and use them for
		another purpose. Our models still generated probabilities of getting 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 runs that could be used both
		to evaluate our models and to evaluate the likelihoods that certain batters would achieve those outcomes in a given
		situation. By comparing these probabilities from one batter to another, we could still have a method of comparing what
		batters might be successful in scoring in crucial plate appearances. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact, we could still evaluate our models by using mean-squared loss. We can take our predicted probabilities for each
		possible classification (0 through 4 runs) on each given plate appearance and we turn it into a vector of those five
		probabilities. Then, we find the difference between the predicted vector for an appearance and the actual one-hot-encoded 
		vector that gives us the actual classification for that plate appearance. We then take the mean of the squares of these
		differences to get the mean squared loss. This mean squared loss is thus a way to determine how well our predicted 
		probabilities of runs scored on plays mirror the actual runs scored by plays, and is a suitable alternative to 
		discrete classification accuracy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is a table that shows the mean squared error for each of our modeling methods used:

	<p>
		For comparison, we also ran a naive model that takes in the distribution of the training data's outcomes for runs scored
		on each plate appearance, and just takes a weighted sample from the distribution to predict any given play
		without considering any predictors (based on how often each number of runs occurs). When we calculate the
		mean-squared error for the naive model, we find that
		its mean-squared error is around 0.0355. This means that most of our models 
		(save for AdaBoost and the Balanced Multinomial	Logistic Regression) have a smaller mean-squared error - 
		meaning that their predicted probabilities for the possible
		outcomes are actually better than just trying to mirror the distribution of the data through random samples. 
		This means that our models' probabilities are indeed giving us helpful information in predicting plays! 
	</p>
	<p>
		While our decision tree appears to have the best mean-squared error here, we find that it only divides the data into
		four possible outcomes rather than the five that we need (it's a depth-2 tree, so it only splits the data two times to 
		give four possible ways to classify possible outcomes). Thus, we decided to create an ensemble model that also 
		incorporates a k-nearest neighbors regression with the decision tree and a multinomial logistic model. This last
		ensemble model had a mean-squared error of .032984, which was still better than any other models besides our decision
		tree. 	
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, in conclusion for our modeling work, we chose this ensemble model, which has a mean-squared error that is improved
		over both individual predictive models and just trying to mirror the original data's distribution. Now that we had this
		ensemble model that could predict the probability of scoring 0 runs, 4 runs, or anything in between for a particular
		plate appearance, we had to put the model into action to learn about how bases occupied and batter stats would influence our
		our predictions for that play. Let's take a look at the <a href = "/results">results of our work</a> in investigating
		our study questions.
