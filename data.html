	<h2>Data</h2>
	<h3>Scraping the Data</h3>
	<p>
		To study our question, we gathered play-by-play data for all games played in the 2017 season. 
		Our scraped play-by-play data, which we gathered from <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB-schedule.shtml">
		https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB-schedule.shtml</a>, records the following things:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Batter: Who is at bat?</li>
		<li>Pitcher: Who is the opposing pitcher?</li>
		<li>Baserunners: Do baserunners occupy first, second, and/or third base?</li>
		<li>Teams: What teams are playing (batting team, fielding team)?</li>
		<li>Score: What is the score of the game at this point?</li>
		<li>Outcome: How many runs are scored on this play?</li>
    	</ul>
	<p>
		This data was scraped from the web from the baseball reference pages, and then we worked to clean and manipulate it
		so that we could have a variable for whether each individual base was occupied, as well as a calculation of the number
		of runs scored on each particular plate appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to this data, we also gathered two other kinds of data: data on the seasonal batting statistics of all players
		from 2000 to 2017 (from <a href = "http://www.espn.com/mlb/stats/batting/\_/year/">ESPN</a>), as well as data on teams' 
		defensive/fielding statistics for all teams from 2000 to 2017 (from <a href = "http://www.espn.com/mlb/stats/team/\_/stat/fielding/year/">ESPN</a>). 
		We then matched up batters' statistics (from 2016) and defensive teams' fielding statistics (from 2016) to each play, and 
		used this matched-up data set to train our baseline model. 
	</p>
	<h3>EDA Lesson #1: It's important to have your bases loaded!</h3>
	<p>
		When first looking at the play-by-play data, one interesting feature stood out that immediately seemed intuitively 
		useful - whether each base is occupied. Intuitively, you would expect that if 
		you have runners on base, you have a much better chance of scoring some number of runs on a plate appearance - and it 
		turns out that this is the case, as shown below:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/OnBase.png"
     		alt="Having runners on base is correlated with higher average runs scored on a play."
     		title="Run Scored based on Bases Occupied">
	</p>
	<p>
		As we see above, it's clear that having a runner on any base is highly linked to runs being scored. Even when a runner 
		is on first base, more runs are scored on average through a plate appearance (around .2 runs per plate appearance) than 
		for those without a runner on first base (less than .1 runs per plate appearance). And for second base (the "runner in 
		scoring position"!) the disparity is enhanced (around .3 vs .07), and even further when we have a runner on third base 
		(around .5 vs .07). Thus, as we might expect, having a runner on a later base is linked to increased runs scored on 
		average on a plate appearance, and having any runner on base at all (even first base) is also linked to increased runs 
		scored on average for a plate appearance.
	</p>
	<h3>EDA Lesson #2: The score of the game has less effect than the state of the bases.</h3>
	<p>
		One aspect that we found to have little linkage to runs scored during a plate appearance was that of the score of the 
		batting or fielding team when a plate appearance occurred. Below, you can see that except for a 
		couple of outlier scores, the average number of runs scored for a plate appearance varied relatively little when 
		comparing the averages over many possible scores. 
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/FieldingPbP.PNG"
     		alt="Score of the fielding team has only a minimal efect on plate appearances."
     		title="Fielding Play-by-Play EDA">
	</p>
	<p>
		There are slight trends we might identify; low-scoring teams in a game seem to have slightly smaller average points 
		scored per plate appearance when at bat, and teams tend to score slightly less per plate appearance when the fielding 
		team has allowed more points already. But in either case, neither trend appears as significant as one might expect (even 
		ignoring the outliers for the very few high-scoring games with over 16 runs in the game scored by one team). Still, 
		there's enough of a samll trend (when looking at both scores of batting and fielding teams) that we might want to 
		investigate this further in later studies besides this project.
	</p>
	<h3>EDA Lesson #3: Scoring plays have batters who have created more runs and hit more fly balls on average.</h3>
	<p>
		By grouping the play-by-play data based on which plays generated runs and which plays did not generate runs, we can take
		a look at two factors that seem to link with generating runs.
	</p>
	<p> 
		First off, scoring plate appearances in 2017 featured batters with 3.2 more runs created on average 
		(based on 2016) than non-scoring plate appearances. Batters in scoring plays had 67.6 runs created in 2016 on average,
		while batters in non-scoring plays had 64.4 runs created in 2016 on average:

     		alt="Scoring appearances featured hitters with slightly more runs created in 2016 on average."
     		title="Runs Created EDA">
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, scoring plate appearances in 2017 featured batters who hit slightly more fly balls per ground ball on average
		than batters for non-scoring plate appearances, as shown below. The trend also held for isolated power, where batters 
		for scoring plate appearances had slightly higher isolated power on average compared to those for non-scoring plate
		appearances.

	<h3>Our finalized study questions:</h3>
	<p>
		In all of this EDA, we noticed the strong links between having baserunnners on base and scoring on a plate appearances, 
		and also looked at the impacts of game scores and batting statistics on plate appearances. Thus, in the wake of our exploratory 
		data analysis and research, we thus decided to focus on the following study questions:	
	</p>
	<p>
		Using this data, can we develop strategies for picking batters in a given scenario, and determine what scenarios
		make batters most likely to score? Namely:
	</p>
	<ul>	
		<li>Is it possible at all to do better than random chance in predicting outcomes of plate appearances?</li>
		<li>How important are bases occupied in predicting whether points will be scored or not on a play?</li>
		<li>What kinds of batters are better to pick when...
			<ul class = "mini">
				<li>the bases are loaded?</li>
				<li>a runner is on third base?</li>
				<li>a runner is in scoring position (on second base)?</li>
				<li>no one is on base?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Why these questions matter, and why they're difficult to answer:</h3>
	<p>
		If we knew how to answer the above questions, our models could help to really improve coaches' decisions and help
		them determine which batters to play in which situations. The main mechanism that our model would be useful for is
		that of pinch hitting, where coaches can substitute in batters into the lineup at key moments in the game if they 
		feel that the situation warrants such a substitution. A model that takes batters' statistics and tells us which 
		batters are more likely to do better in a given situation could tell a coach whether to substitute in a pinch hitter
		or not (when the bases are loaded, when your team is down by a certain number of runs, etc.). A model that could
		differentiate between different batters for various situations would take some of the guesswork out of figuring out
		when to have batters pinch hit. And even generally, figuring out which batters are best in general for scoring runs
		would help coaches figure out which players should play games or which players they should aim to recruit for their
		teams in the off-season.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's challenging about answering these questions, however, is that it's hard to figure out when runs will be scored
		because our play-by-play data is quite unbalanced. Around 90% of the plays generate no runs at all, and very, very 
		few plays are able to generate 2 or more runs. This means that any model that we hope to train on the data will just 
		not have that much data on plays with runs scored to work with when it tries to figure out which plays will score runs
		and which plays will not. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Undaunted, to begin to answer these questions, we began working on the<a href = "/methodology">modeling aspect</a>
		of our project.
