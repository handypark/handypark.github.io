	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Often cited as the nation's great pastime, baseball has taken on life as a professional sport over the last century.
		In Major League Baseball (MLB), the professional baseball league for the United States, thirty teams each year 
		compete over the course of a 162-game season, batting, pitching, and fielding their way in their pursuit of hopefully
		making it to the playoffs and winning the World Series to become the national champions. All of these games yield massive
		amounts of play-by-play data that could be used to measure and predict player performance.
	</p>
	<p>
		While collecting and exploring this play-by-play data, our project team wondered if there were 
		ways that coaches could use data-based models, rather than gut feelings, to make coaching decisions involving batters
		in crucial game situations. We wondered whether in certain game scenarios, what factors would make one
		batter more likely to succeed scoring points for a batting team than another; given statistical data regarding
		teams' and players' previous seasons and performance in those seasons, could we predict outcomes of plate appearances?
		Thus, we decided to tackle the following problem statement:
	</p>
	<h2>Overall Initial Problem Statement</h2>
	<p>
		On any given single plate appearance, given statistical data on the batter and the fielding team and information about the 
		game scenario (including whether bases are occupied and the score of the game), can we predict how likely a batter is 
		to score one of the five possible amounts of runs (between 0 and 4), and how many runs do we expect the batter to score?
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that for this project, we revised our study question to focus on particular plays rather than entire innings 
		(with the hopes of later assessing questions involving single play-related aspects of baseball 
		like pinch hitting for particular scenarios). 
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to answer this overall question, we first had to first <a href="/research">do some research.</a>
