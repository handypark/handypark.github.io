	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>
		Now that we have our model (as explained in <a href="/methodology">Methodology</a>), it's time for us to answer
		some of these questions that we asked about in our <a href = "/data">Data</a> section.
	</p>
	<h3>Question 1: Can a predictive model help predict runs scored on a plate appearance?</h3>
	<p>
		In short - <strong>yes.</strong> In some sense, we found here that any of our modeling techniques had the same
		flaw - no matter what we did, all of them predicted that every play would result in zero runs. In that most basic sense,
		some might claim that our model can't predict how many runs will be scored by a play.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, our model still gave us some very important predictive power - namely, even though we couldn't get discrete
		classifications, we still managed to find prediction probabilities that performed significantly better than just taking
		a naive, random weighted sample (based on the distribution of runs scored on plate appearances in the training data). 
		Our final ensemble model (along with many of our other models) gave us probabilities for the number of runs created 
		by a plate appearance that more closely mirrored real-life plate appearances than a weighted random model that takes
		none of the predictors we used into consideration. This result is evidenced by the significant reduction in 
		mean-squared error that we achieved through our ensemble model (as compared to a model that utilized none of the
		statistical predictors our model used). 
	</p>
	<p>
		Because we are able to provide probabilities for individual plate appearances
		that are meaningful and more accurate due to the batting, defensive, and base occupancy predictors they utilize, we have
		created a tool that coaches could use to assess how likely a plate appearance is to produce any number of runs. And since
		our tool takes things like batting statistics, defensive statistics, and base occupancies into account, which vary
		over the course of a baseball game, coaches can use the model situationally to predict the likelihoods of scoring runs 
		or not for a given play in a baseball game just by entering the relevant statistics and situational predictors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, while our model might not be able to predict that a play will produce runs, it can definitely give probabilities
		as to how likely a play is to produce runs based on the situation you're in - and if you're a coach, this knowledge can
		certainly help.
