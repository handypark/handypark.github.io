	<h2>Research</h2>
	<h3>Background Knowledge</h3>
	<p>
		Our initial plan to work with the data in our models was to work with batting statistics, fielding statistics,
		and pitching statistics. Specifically, as part of our plan to use all three kinds of statistcs as indicators for 
		the outcome of a plate appearance, we originally theorized that given a stronger pitcher or a weaker pitcher 
		(which we might be able to detect via pitching statistics), a batter would have
		a stronger or weaker chance of scoring a run or not scoring a run. Baseball fans often point to statistics such as ERA 
		(Earned Runs Allowed) or the number of wins a pitcher has to point to the success or failure of pitchers to stop 
		opposing batters from successfully scoring, and we had similar beliefs before we conducted further research on
		pitching statistics. And after all, it makes sense - better pitchers should be able to shut down opposing batters,
		while weaker pitchers should probably allow more runs.
	</p>
	<h3>Review of Literature</h3>
	<p>
		However, our review of the literature actually showed us an important aspect that we then decided to take
		into consideration for our models - pitching statistics are not a good predictor of opponents' batting success. 
		Utilizing pitching statistics might contribute more noise to our model predictions rather than actually helping us
		see whether plate appearances by batters would be likely to score runs or not score runs.
	</p>
	<p>
		A couple of resources helped us to determine that using pitching statistics might not be a great plan, by talking about the lack
		of importance of pitching overall in preventing runs. One important source of information was the seminal research of Voros McCracken, which
		he reported on in 2001. McCracken's work (1) 
		divided pitchers' statistical performance into two categories: defense-dependent statistics, and defense-independent statistics.
		McCracken used these categories to help assess the effect that pitchers had on gameplay, and found that repeatedly that no
		matter what angle he used to assess the effect of pitching, the answer was that pitching had negligible impact on opposing
		teams' batting success in getting a hit on a ball in play. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This result was not completely unprecedented - previous researchers had even listed the problem of separating fielding and
		pitching as one of baseball analysis's "Hilbert Problems" (2).
		And McCracken's work was pretty generally accepted - a more recent article in 2012 explains that McCracken's work was groundbreaking
		and changed the mind of most analysts; nowadays, preventing runs from happening is a job that is attributed more to an entire defensive
		team of fielders rather than just being influenced by pitchers. This shift in perspective de-emphasizes pitchers to the point that
		even sheer "dumb luck" can contribute just as much to batter success or failure as a pitcher (3).
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, while some group members initially wanted to utilize pitching data, our team ultimately decided against using pitching data
		to evaluate the probability of a batter successfully scoring runs on a plate appearance or not. The research we did gave us 
		evidence to show that using pitching statistics to assess the likely outcomes of batters' plate appearances would actually
		give us more noise than predictive power.

		Equipped with this new knowledge, we began to <a href="/data">scrape the other kinds of data</a> for our model.
